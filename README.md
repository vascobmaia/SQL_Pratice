# SQL_Practice â€” Zero to Hero (Udemy Course)

This repository contains the exercises I completed while taking the **"The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero"** course on Udemy. The goal is to strengthen my PostgreSQL skills by analyzing the **DVD Rental** database and exploring key SQL concepts such as queries, joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and table creation.

Through this project, I aim to enhance my SQL knowledge and document my progress in data analysis and relational database modeling.
