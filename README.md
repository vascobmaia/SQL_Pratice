# SQL_Pratice Zero to Hero Udemy course
This repository contains the exercises I completed while taking the “The Complete SQL Bootcamp” course on Udemy.
The goal is to strengthen my PostgreSQL skills by analyzing the DVD Rental database, exploring concepts such as queries, joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and table creation.

Through this project, I aim to enhance my SQL knowledge and share my progress in data analysis and relational database modeling.
